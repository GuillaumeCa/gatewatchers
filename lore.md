## Plot

a long disappeared civilisation and its very advanced technologies. You are travelling the galaxy by using gates that the lost civilisation left behind.
Most gates are not functionning and need to be repaired. You need to go to planets to find the materials needed to fix them. 
Be carefull, the Drexuls are also trying to fix the gates to find the lost city before humanity.


## Drexuls
An alien species living in the Drexi system inside the galaxy. They have been enslaved by the lost civilisation for many centuries 
and are trying to get revenge by retrieving their technology. They are bipedals, with lots of cybernetics.
